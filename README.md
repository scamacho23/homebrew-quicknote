**Liszt makes it easy to jot down thoughts in the command line, and
keep ideas clear in separate notes.**

## Installation

*Please note that at the moment, **Liszt** is only functional on macOS.*

*Please also note that v1.1.8 does change some existing functionality that will cause incompatibility with
the existing **Liszt** file system on your computer. If you already have **Liszt** installed, before
updating to v1.1.8, please go to your ~/.liszt directory and rename the directory called 'notes' to
'main'.*

### Homebrew

*In your terminal*
```
$ brew tap liszt-music/liszt
$ brew install lst
```
These commands will install the tap of **Liszt** on your system and then install the executable
'lst' in /usr/local/bin. 

###Git Clone

*In your terminal*

```
$ git clone https://github.com/scamacho23/liszt.git
$ cd liszt 
$ cmake .
$ make
$ make install
```

**Liszt** relies on cmake for compilation and linking so we recommend having cmake installed on your
system. Alternatively, the following should do the trick (we use clang but any c compiler should work):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/scamacho23/liszt.git
$ cd liszt 
$ clang src/main.c -o lst -g
$ ln -s lst /usr/local/bin/lst
```

### Pkg Installer
Click on [this](liszt-1.1.8.pkg) to be redirected to the local liszt-1.1.8.pkg
file. Click 'download' on the right side of the page to download the package
installer.

*Any issues with installation should be emailed to liszt.central@gmail.com*
